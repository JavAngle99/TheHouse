#The House
- Adds the House, a mad gambler who relies on his luck to push through tough situations, using two mysterious artifacts of fate: a 6-Shooter-Revolver named "Roulette" and a seemingly cursed deck of playing cards
- Instead of having a Secondary, Utility, and Special abilities, The House draws 3 cards from a deck of 51 (He keeps the 52nd card in his hat) and uses them instead, upon using a card, he loses all three and draws a new hand,
  once you've run out of cards, the Discard pile is shuffled back into the draw pile, and you start over again.
- His Revolver "Roulette" has 6 bullets that it fires in a random order, and cannot shoot while empty, in order to reload the gun, you must activate one of the three drawn cards.
- Inlcudes configs for Simplified Crosshair, Crosshair Position, Crosshair Size, Even having a Crosshair, Simplified Card Table, Card Table position, Card Table size, and including the Cylinder display near the Card Table.
- List of cards, bullets, and their effects can be seen in-game in the loadout screen (Display only)

Various HUD variants, Customizable in Config

#Known bugs
- In Multiplayer, sometimes the random number generator desyncs with clients, I don't know why this happens most of the times that it has, but it's rare enough that I don't realy care.
- One way that I do know desyncs can happen, is if a player takes too long to load in, this will cause that player to be desynced, which can cause wack to happen.
- Wildcard is buggy in multiplayer, expect jank.

- ~~Killing Mithrix with Russian Roulette seems to crash the game.~~ ?I can't seem to kill Mithrix with it anymore?
- ~~Dio's best friend revives you, but you become useless.~~
- The camera doesn't follow your corpse when you die.
